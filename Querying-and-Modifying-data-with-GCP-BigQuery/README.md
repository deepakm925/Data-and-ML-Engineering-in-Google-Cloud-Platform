# QUERYING AND MODIFYING A DATASET WITH GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORMS's BIG QUERY

## DESCRIPTION
In this Project, we will dive into using one of the biggest Data warehousing tools Google Cloud's BigQuery application. Here we will cover the Basics of loading, editing, and modifying datasets and databases in BigQuery. The language that is used to communicate with the database to extract queries is SQL. 

### The Dataset
The dataset is a public dataset called : [USA-NAMES](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/social-security-administration/us-names?project=practical-block-410401) which can be found within the Google Cloud console's exploration feature. 

## WHAT TO EXPECT...
- Create a new Project
- Enable the BigQuery API Access
- Open BigQuery Studio to download a public dataset to use
- Use MySQL command to perform queries on the dataset
- Modify Data from a text document to CSV format
- Load and create queries using SQL in the newly created dataset

## PROJECT STEPS
All Project steps will be displayed using GIFs with me implementing the steps. This enhances the appeal and understanding of the project. 

### <ins> STEP ONE: Creating a New Project in Google Platform Console </ins>
In this first step, we will create a **New Project ** in our Google Cloud Console. We can name it whatever we wish, but I chose to name mine **My-first-BigQuery-Project**.
