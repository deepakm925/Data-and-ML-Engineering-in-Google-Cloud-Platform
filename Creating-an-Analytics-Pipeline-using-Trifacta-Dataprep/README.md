# CREATING AN ANALYTICS PIPELINE USING TRIFACTA's DATAPREP APPLICATION

### DESCRIPTION

I have worked with data using Microsoft Power BI and its respective libraries to perform data analysis. However, I will use a more specialized tool called DataPrep by Trifacta for this project to create a Data Pipeline. The Data pipeline will do the following:
- Connect to BigQuery and import a dataset 
- Explore dataset quality with Cloud Dataprep
