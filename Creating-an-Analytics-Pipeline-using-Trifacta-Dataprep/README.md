# CREATING AN ANALYTICS PIPELINE USING TRIFACTA's DATAPREP APPLICATION

### DESCRIPTION

Similar to Microsoft Power BI and its respective libraries for performing data analysis, a more specialized tool called DataPrep by Trifacta is used for this project to create a Data Pipeline within the Google Cloud Platform. This project will:
- Connect to BigQuery and import a dataset 
- Explore dataset quality with Cloud Dataprep
- Create a data transformation pipeline with Cloud Dataprep
- Schedule transformation jobs outputs to BigQuery
